# Death_Penalty
 Here is my first project for my data studio class with the one and only Jonathan Soma. I did some data clean up, some website stuff then some story stuff. 
I found that in 2021, a sharp drop in support of the death penalty occurred, but the data showed an pretty immediate bounce back in 2022. I had to combine two of the GSS survey's on death penalty opposition in support going back to the early 1970s. GSS data, alongside the death penalty part, can be found easily here: https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/home.
In my data clean up process, I just had to combine two data sets, which I did through pandas. I thought that the data analysis was the most interesting part of the job because I feel like the data actually surprised me. 
Honestly, I learned the most from this is that you really have to have such a keen eye with data stuff. I had to do some manual clean up with quotes and stuff, and I kept on doubting myself in making sure I was not misrepresenting the data in anyway. Honestly, even though DataWrapper is easy to use, I wish I could've used something that had more options for data visualization, even if I know they'll be harder. I felt like some of my graphs were a bit too simple.
